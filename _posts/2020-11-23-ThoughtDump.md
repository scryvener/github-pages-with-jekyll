Today I thought about how with neuralink progressing, Ekso Bionics may be an attractive investment going forward. mind controlled exoskeletons and such. Not sure if Ekso will survie that long, they look like they've been plodding along for awhile, kind of like Organovo, a tech that was too far ahead of the the support,
but they did get FDA approval this year, so it looks like they are making progress. Plus its not like they are dependent on the neuralink idea to work. Exoskeletons will still be useful without brain interface tech.
